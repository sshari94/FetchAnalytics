Assumptions:

Key assumptions about your data model and business logic:

Receipts Table:

Each receipt is associated with a user.
Receipts have a rewardsReceiptStatus (such as "Accepted" or "Rejected").
Each receipt contains a total_spent and purchased_item_count, which will be useful for comparing spend and transactions.

Brand-Receipt Link:

Each item in the receipt is linked to a specific brand via barcode. We can assume that each item belongs to one brand, which allows us to group receipts by brands.

User Data:

Users have a created_date field that allows us to filter those created in the past 6 months.

Month Periods:

"Recent month" is the current month, and "Previous month" refers to the month prior to that.



For now we use the CPG in the same table in brands but if we get more information, we should normalize by creating a new CPG table with its own data. So i have included that in the ER diagram as well.
