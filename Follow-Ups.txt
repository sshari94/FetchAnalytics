Subject: Data Quality Review and Next Steps

Hi [Stakeholder's Name],

I hope you’re doing well! I’ve been reviewing the dataset provided for the project, and I wanted to share some of the key findings and follow-up questions that will help ensure we’re working with high-quality, actionable data.

Questions About the Data:
Data Provenance & Updates: Can you confirm how often the data is refreshed or updated? Knowing the update frequency will help us understand how dynamic the dataset is.

Field Definitions: Some fields (like user_id or state) have slightly ambiguous definitions. Could you provide more clarity on how these values are expected to behave (e.g., should state always follow the two-letter postal format, and are there any exceptions)?

Data Sources: Are there additional data sources that might not be included here but would be valuable for our analysis (e.g., transactional data, or customer feedback)?

Data Quality Issues:
While reviewing the data, I ran some exploratory checks and discovered a few data quality issues that could impact our analysis:

Missing Values: Several columns have missing values, which can lead to incomplete analysis or bias.
Inconsistent Data Types: Some fields seem to have mixed types (e.g., some numeric columns contain text). This can affect calculations and aggregations.
Duplicate Entries: There appear to be duplicate user records, which could skew metrics like average spend or transaction volume.
Out-of-Range Values: We found some negative values in fields where they wouldn’t make sense, such as total_spent and points_earned.
Next Steps to Resolve Data Quality Issues:
To clean and optimize the data, I’ll need further clarification on a few points:

Handling Missing Data: Should we fill missing values with default values (like zeros or averages), or would you prefer to discard records with missing critical fields?

Inconsistent Data Types: What is the best approach to handle mismatched data types? For instance, if a column is meant to store numerical data, but it has some text entries, should we clean these entries or flag them for further review?

Duplicate Records: Are duplicate user records common, or is this an anomaly? If these duplicates are problematic, how should we proceed with identifying and removing them?

Out-of-Range Values: For the fields with negative values (e.g., total_spent, points_earned), should we set a rule to ignore negative values or flag them for investigation?

Optimizing Data Assets:
To further optimize the data we’re working with, it would be helpful to know:

Are there any known trends in the data (e.g., specific users or products that typically have outliers)?
Would you like us to incorporate additional metadata or derived columns (e.g., average transaction value or customer lifetime value)?
Are there any specific reporting requirements or KPIs that we should keep in mind when shaping the data?
Performance and Scaling Concerns:
As we move toward production, a few key considerations for performance and scalability come to mind:

Large Volume of Data: If the dataset continues to grow (e.g., with more users or transactions), we may need to consider data partitioning or using distributed databases to improve query performance.

Data Indexing: Ensuring that our key fields (such as user_id, transaction_id, or brand_id) are indexed can significantly speed up aggregations and filtering processes.

Real-Time Processing: If we start to incorporate more real-time or near-real-time data (e.g., transaction data), we may need to rethink the architecture to handle streaming data efficiently.

Please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions on how we should proceed with resolving these data quality issues. I’m happy to set up a call if it’s easier to walk through the findings together!

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best regards,
Srihari Srithar
